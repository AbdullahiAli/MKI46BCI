### How do I set it up? ###

The BufferBCIApp is a separate application which both provides the BufferServerService and BufferClientsService and a simple gui for controlling these services. This should be installed to the developing Android device. Services don't provide a GUI (but do give a notification) so don't expect a application to pop up, they will run in the background once they are started by the Unity project (through the BufferServicesController).

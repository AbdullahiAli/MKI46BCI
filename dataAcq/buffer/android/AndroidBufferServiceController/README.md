# Dependencies #
This project depends on:
- The BufferClient.jar from the BufferBCI project (https://github.com/jadref/buffer_bci/tree/master/dataAcq/buffer/java)

# Packaging #
The yearmonthday_androidfieldtripbufferservicecontroller.apk can be created using Gradle and Intelij. Import this project as a Gradle project and make sure all the libraries are available and recognized. Run the app module. Once this is done, the app/build/outputs contains two .apk files. I copied the app-debug.apk to the root folder.
